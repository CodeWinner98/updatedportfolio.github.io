# updatedportfolio.github.io
I have built the foundation of my portfolio webpage using HTML, CSS, and
JavaScript, to add server-side functionality using PHP. I enhance your webpage by incorporating the following PHP features:
1. Form Validation and Input Sanitization:
● Implemented PHP code to validate and sanitize the following fields in my
contact form:
● Display appropriate error messages if any field fails validation.
2. Database Integration:
● Created a MySQL database to store booking details. 
● Establish a database connection.
● Insert new project details into the database.
● Retrieve project data from the database.
● Update project information.
● Delete projects if necessary.
3. User Authentication:
● Created a table in the database to store user account details. Include
columns such as:
● Use PHP sessions to keep track of authenticated users.
4. PHP Functions:
● Created a PHP file named dbFunction.php to contain my custom functions.
● Wrote functions such as
● validateForm(): Perform form validation and return an array of error
messages.
● connectDatabase(): Establish a database connection and return the
connection object.
● insertProject(): Insert project details into the database.
● getProjects(): Retrieve project data from the database.
● updateProject(): Update project information in the database.
● deleteProject(): Delete projects from the database.
